      # @!attribute auto_renew
      #   @return [Boolean] Whether the subscription renews at the end of its term.
      define_attribute :auto_renew, :Boolean

      # @!attribute billing_info_id
      #   @return [String] The `billing_info_id` is the value that represents a specific billing info for an end customer. When `billing_info_id` is used to assign billing info to the subscription, all future billing events for the subscription will bill to the specified billing info. `billing_info_id` can ONLY be used for sites utilizing the Wallet feature.
      define_attribute :billing_info_id, String

      # @!attribute collection_method
      #   @return [String] Change collection method
      define_attribute :collection_method, String

      # @!attribute custom_fields
      #   @return [Array[CustomField]] The custom fields will only be altered when they are included in a request. Sending an empty array will not remove any existing values. To remove a field send the name with a null or empty value.
      define_attribute :custom_fields, Array, { :item_type => :CustomField }

      # @!attribute customer_notes
      #   @return [String] Specify custom notes to add or override Customer Notes. Custom notes will stay with a subscription on all renewals.
      define_attribute :customer_notes, String

      # @!attribute gateway_code
      #   @return [String] If present, this subscription's transactions will use the payment gateway with this code.
      define_attribute :gateway_code, String

      # @!attribute net_terms
      #   @return [Integer] Integer paired with `Net Terms Type` and representing the number of days past the current date (for `net` Net Terms Type) or days after the last day of the current month (for `eom` Net Terms Type) that the invoice will become past due. For any value, an additional 24 hours is added to ensure the customer has the entire last day to make payment before becoming past due.  For example:  If an invoice is due `net 0`, it is due 'On Receipt' and will become past due 24 hours after it's created. If an invoice is due `net 30`, it will become past due at 31 days exactly. If an invoice is due `eom 30`, it will become past due 31 days from the last day of the current month.  When `eom` Net Terms Type is passed, the value for `Net Terms` is restricted to `0, 15, 30, 45, 60, or 90`. For more information please visit our docs page (https://docs.recurly.com/docs/manual-payments#section-collection-terms)
      define_attribute :net_terms, Integer

      # @!attribute net_terms_type
      #   @return [String] Optionally supplied string that may be either `net` or `eom` (end-of-month). When `net`, an invoice becomes past due the specified number of `Net Terms` days from the current date. When `eom` an invoice becomes past due the specified number of `Net Terms` days from the last day of the current month.  This field is only available when the EOM Net Terms feature is enabled.
      define_attribute :net_terms_type, String

      # @!attribute next_bill_date
      #   @return [DateTime] If present, this sets the date the subscription's next billing period will start (`current_period_ends_at`). This can be used to align the subscription’s billing to a specific day of the month. For a subscription in a trial period, this will change when the trial expires. This parameter is useful for postponement of a subscription to change its billing date without proration.
      define_attribute :next_bill_date, DateTime

      # @!attribute po_number
      #   @return [String] For manual invoicing, this identifies the PO number associated with the subscription.
      define_attribute :po_number, String

      # @!attribute remaining_billing_cycles
      #   @return [Integer] The remaining billing cycles in the current term.
      define_attribute :remaining_billing_cycles, Integer

      # @!attribute renewal_billing_cycles
      #   @return [Integer] If `auto_renew=true`, when a term completes, `total_billing_cycles` takes this value as the length of subsequent terms. Defaults to the plan's `total_billing_cycles`.
      define_attribute :renewal_billing_cycles, Integer

      # @!attribute revenue_schedule_type
      #   @return [String] Revenue schedule type
